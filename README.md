## Deployment System Overview

The backend is containerized using **Docker** with a single `web` service (Django + SQLite).  
When executed, Docker automatically:
1. Builds the image from the provided `Dockerfile`.
2. Applies database migrations.
3. Starts the Django development server inside the container.
4. Exposes port **8000** to the host machine (`http://localhost:8000`).

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|
| Backend | Django 5.2.7 |
| Frontend | Tailwind CSS (via CDN) |
| Database | SQLite3 (default, zero setup) |
| Language | Python 3.13.9 |
| AI Integration | OpenAI or DeepSeek API |

## Run Locally (without Docker)

### Step 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaobaionly/ELEC5620-Group-15.git
cd ELEC5620-Group-15
```

### Step 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows
# or
source .venv/bin/activate       # macOS / Linux
```

### Step 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4. Configure your `.env` file

The `.env` file is already included in the project.  
You only need to **insert your own OpenAI API key** in the correct place.

```env
# AI Provider Settings
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
LLM_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

> **Note:** Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key before running the project.

### Step 5. Initialize and run the database
Run the following commands to set up your database schema:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Then start the local development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

After the server starts, open the following URLs in your browser:  
Main site: http://127.0.0.1:8000  
Admin site: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

## Run with Docker 

This setup runs only the **Django backend** inside Docker using **SQLite**.

### Step 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaobaionly/ELEC5620-Group-15.git
cd ELEC5620-Group-15
```

### Step 2. Configure your `.env` file

The `.env` file is already included in the project.  
You only need to **insert your own OpenAI API key** in the correct place.

```env
# AI Provider Settings
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
LLM_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

> **Note:** Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key before running the project.


### Step 3. Build the image
```bash
docker compose build
```

### Step 4. Start the container
```bash
docker compose up
```

After the server starts, open the following URLs in your browser:  
Main site: http://localhost:8000
Admin site: http://localhost:8000/admin
