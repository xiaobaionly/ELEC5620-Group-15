## Environment Setup

### Step 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaobaionly/ELEC5620-Group-15.git
cd ELEC5620-Group-15
```

### Step 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows PowerShell
# or
source .venv/bin/activate       # macOS / Linux
```

### Step 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4. Configure your `.env` file

The `.env` file is already included in the project.  
You only need to **insert your own OpenAI API key** in the correct place.

```env
# AI Provider Settings
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
LLM_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

> **Note:** Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key before running the project.

### Step 5. Initialize and run the database
Run the following commands to set up your database schema:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Then start the local development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access your app at:
